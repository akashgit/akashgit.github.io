# Akash Srivastava

I am the Director and Chief Architect of Core AI at IBM, where I lead the research and development of **AgentOps**—our platform for building, evaluating, and optimizing agentic AI systems. My work spans three core pillars: (1) **Evaluation** through red-teaming and robustness testing, (2) **Optimization** via inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning, and post-training methods, and (3) **Observability** for production deployment. I also lead IBM's post-training efforts for foundation models, developing alignment techniques and synthetic data generation methods.

I am a Principal Investigator at the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) and previously founded the **Red Hat AI Innovation Team** (now in advisory role), where we created [**InstructLab**](https://instructlab.ai/)—an open-source framework for LLM customization that went from concept to production in a record-breaking 9 months. InstructLab enables efficient model tuning and has been adopted by enterprises and the open-source community.

Before joining IBM, I obtained my PhD at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked with [Prof Charles Sutton](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/) and [Prof Michael U. Gutmann](https://michaelgutmann.github.io/) on [variational inference for generative models and deep learning](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=2h6SZeEAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=2h6SZeEAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC).
